# ISOM3350_Tokenization

## Introduction
We modified the code on Ethereum Remix to run the tokenization code using the more updated (^v0.6) compilers. We added an ERC20 interface and Owned class to create a simplified version of ERC20 standards and ownership before running the main code. 
In addition to our source code, we added multiple asset and P2P trading support to the contract.
